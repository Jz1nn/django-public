# Django Project - Improving Python with the Django Framework

Here, during my college break, I've been spending some time improving my Python skills along with the Django Framework. In this post, I'd like to share the public files of this ongoing project.

## Goal and Progress

The goal of this project is to develop a practical, working application that demonstrates my evolution and mastery of the Python language and the Django Framework. Although I've been working on it privately up until now, I've decided to make it public to share my progress.

I'm currently finalizing the actual project, which is a more specific and applied version of this "generic" project. As time allows, I'll continue to update it based on the progress and additional features of the actual project.

## Future Content

I'll soon provide a detailed tutorial on how to install and use this project. I'll also describe the specific utility it provides.
